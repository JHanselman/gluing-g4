Description
--

This repository contains Magma code for gluing curves along their torsion, both by geometric methods (upcoming) and by analytic methods (fully implemented).

Prerequisites
--

An installation of Magma and the dependency [`JRSijsling/curve_reconstruction`](https://github.com/JRSijsling/curve_reconstruction). You will need Neurohr's algorithms mentioned in said dependency.

Installation 
--

You can enable the functionality of this package in Magma by attaching the `gluing/magma/spec` file with `AttachSpec`. To make this independent of the directory in which you find yourself, and to active this on startup by default, you may want to indicate the relative path in your `~/.magmarc` file, by adding the line
```
AttachSpec("~/Programs/gluing/magma/spec");
```

Usage
--

Examples are given in the directory `examples/`.

Verbose comments are enabled by
```
SetVerbose("Gluing", n);
```
where and `n` is either `1` or `2`. A higher value gives more comments.


Citing this code
--

These methods, as well as the upcoming geometric part of this package, are based on the Ph.D. thesis of Jeroen Hanselman at the Universit√§t Ulm, which is work in progress. Please cite this work if this code has been helpful in your research.
